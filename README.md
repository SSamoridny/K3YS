# K3YS NFT Project
In this project, I worked with K3YS marketing manager to build their micro site. Upon my initial meeting I had come up with various ideas of how to add a landing page with audio and fun visual effects. Upon speaking we felt it was more important to focus simply on the art, which is the real star. This was a perfect learning experience for myself as I had great conversations with their manager about their vision that I was able to deliver on. While I had large ideas that showcased my skills I quickly realized the most important part, it is not about me and what I hope to put out but truly about what the customer wants and how I can deliver it to them. Also as a glimpse into the real world of business I was also asked to cease adding any more items to this site as the project fell apart towards the end of their first phase. More art had been created but the partnership between marketing and the artist no longer existed. 

# Languages and Tools Used
- CSS and HTML
- Using CSS techniques I was able to create a mobile friendly and responsive site with links to all of their key compnents and their contact and marketing needs

# What was Learned
- Just because you can doesn't always mean that you should
- Being able to deliver what the customer needs is the most important feature you can offer
- Work arounds for outside font usage and logo creation based off what the client had asked for
- How to deal with image heavy items where the client asked for larger, uncompressed images and we compromised with smaller images as load times were rather slow
